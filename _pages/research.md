<h2>What is ARC?</h2>

![Illustration of ARC](/images/ARC_representation.png){: .align-right width="150px"}
[Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547) is a benchmark dataset invented by [Fran√ßois Chollet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Chollet), to test the intelligence of artificial systems. Each task has averagely 2 - 5 example pairs and a test input. The solvers are to guess the rule that satisfies all the example pairs and apply test input to get the correct answer. Here, the picture on the right is an example ARC task. What grid would be in the "?" according to the rules found within the example pairs?

This task is simple. However, there are various types of tasks and it is not easy for a machine to solve it. It is known that human beings can solve it around 85% of the time, while machines can only solve it around 42%, according to the [ARC-AGI Leaderboard](https://arcprize.org/leaderboard#arc-agi-pub).

Here is one additional note for you if you are interested in solving ARC tasks. Please visit [o2arc.com](https://o2arc.com/). This is a web application created by our lab, where you can see and solve other ARC tasks. You can also create your own tasks!


<h2>System-1 and System-2 Thinking</h2>

Have you ever heard of System-1 and System-2 thinking? 

They are two different ways of thinking. System-1 is fast and subconscious, while System-2 is slow and conscious. Due to the characteristics of the two systems, System-1 thinking produces more intuitive fast responses, while System-2 thinking produces more rational and logical responses. Neither is better or worse, they are just different. The point is humans are able to switch between them flexibly!

Currently, most of the AI systems provide pleasing performance on System-1 thinking. They are good at solving tasks that does not require logical processing. The limitation of current AI systems is well-known with the <b>black box issue</b> of the inference process, and <b>lack of explainability</b>. Moreover, considering LLMs as an AI system, they suffer from <b>hallucination</b>. We can see these issues when they are asked to solve tasks that require logical processing.

ARC is a task that requires System-2 thinking. By setting a short-term goal to solve ARC tasks, I am dedicated to develop a new type of AI systems that are able to do System-2 thinking. I am expecting so-called "a new module" to be plugged into the current AI systems and enable them to do System-2 thinking or further plays a role of left/right brain.

<h1>Research Motivation</h1>

To achieve the goal of System-2 thinking by solving ARC, I first pondered on how human beings solve ARC tasks. Not only in shallow and intuitive level, but also in deep and logical level by repeatedly asking "WHY" questions to my solution. The following paragraph became the motivation of my research direction and the background of [Abductive Symbolic Solver on Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3819/paper1.pdf).

<h2>Steps of Human Solving ARC</h2>

I defined 6 steps of human solving ARC tasks. 
1. Observation
2. Pattern, Change, Difference Recognition
3. Rule Formulation + Adjustment
4. Repeat 

5. Observation (Test)
6. Application

Human
