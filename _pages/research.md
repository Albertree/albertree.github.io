![Illustration of ARC](/images/ARC_representation.png){: .align-right width="150px"}
[Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547) is a benchmark dataset invented by [Fran√ßois Chollet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Chollet), to test the intelligence of artificial systems. Each task has averagely 2 - 5 example pairs and a test input. The solvers are to guess the rule that satisfies all the example pairs and apply test input to get the correct answer. Here, the picture on the right is an example ARC task. What grid would be in the "?" according to the rules found within the example pairs?

There is one additional note for you if you are interested in ARC. Please visit [o2arc.com](https://o2arc.com/) to see and solve other ARC tasks. You can also create your own tasks! This web application is a creation of our lab.
