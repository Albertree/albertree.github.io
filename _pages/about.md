👋 I'm a Ph.D. student at the AI Graduate School of Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), South Korea. 🇰🇷 

🧑‍💻 As a member of the Data Science Lab, under the guidance of [Professor Sundong Kim](http://www.sundong.kim), I'm dedicated to developing AI that mimics human problem-solving and decision-making abilities by tackling puzzles that are considered challenging for existing AI technologies to solve. 🧩

🔎 By targeting to achieve system-2 reasoning, I try to solve tasks like Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) with my own creative problem-solving methods derived from human cognition. 🧠

📚 In particular, I'm interested in discovering symbolic modules that can connect neural networks with human-like symbolic representations. For more detail about my research ideas and interests, please take a look at the [research](/research) tab! 🤓

🎯 Currently, it seems like a specific research, but I believe that it would become a starting point to develop human-like AI. Please, feel free to look around my page and [contact](/contact) me if you have any questions! 🤩
